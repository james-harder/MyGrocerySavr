# MyGrocerySavr
A Grocery-List web app designed for a fictional chain of grocery stores.

This app was created by James Harder and Matt Paulson as a class project for MIS 610 - Dynamic Web Programming. The site can be accessed at http://mygrocerysavrtemp.azurewebsites.net/ 

The goals of this app were to create a web app that stored, edited and retrieved data from a MSSQL Server. The app uses ASP.Net framework and T-SQL stored procedures to implement basic CRUD operations. 

The Web-App and SQL Server are hosted on Azure.
